### Technologies
#### Whilom Halls was built with technology used in many popular large scale applications.

#### Database
* Postgresql - Modern database with scalability.
#### Backend
* Ruby - Used for user authorization and for accessing the database.
#### Framework
* Rails - Used in conjunction with Ruby to deploy the application and house the logic and state.
#### Frontend

* React - Javascript library that allows the application to update and rerender only the new information, making for a faster application with less frequent server requests and a more fluid user experience.
* Redux - Javascript library that allows the app to contain and manage fron end state in a predictable and efficient manner.

### Features
#### User Authentication
* This feature allows users to safely create a profile in order to interact with the application personally. User information is safely stored in a database. The user's password is also hashed and salted before being stored - this encryption means that even we do not have access to passwords. Users will be able to create bookings at locations and access them through their user profile.
#### Listings
* This feature allows any number of listings to be placed in the database, storing information from price to bed and bath counts, as well as pictures so that the user knows what to expect from a booking.
